# Titanic Survival Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using logistic regression. The dataset contains detailed information on various features, such as passenger demographics and ticket details. The goal is to build a model that accurately predicts survival outcomes based on these features.

## Key Features:

1. **Imported File**: Loaded the Titanic dataset for analysis.
2. **Checked for Null Values**: Identified missing values within the dataset.
3. **Handled Null Values**: Processed missing values to prepare the data for modeling.
4. **Data Encoding**: Applied encoding techniques to transform categorical data into numerical format.
5. **Label Encoding**: Used Label Encoder for the 'sex', 'cabin', and 'embarked' columns to convert them into numerical values.
6. **Logistic Regression Model**: Built and trained the model to predict the survival of passengers.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Assessed the model's performance using various metrics:
   - **Accuracy Score**: 72.9%
   - **Precision Score**: 79.1%
   - **Recall Score**: 79.1%
   - **ROC Curve and AUC**: Analyzed the ROC curve to find the AUC score.

## Why This Project?

This project showcases how logistic regression can be used to predict binary outcomes—in this case, survival on the Titanic. It highlights the complete data pipeline, from handling missing values to applying machine learning techniques for evaluation. Through this project, you’ll gain insights into the importance of feature encoding, performance evaluation metrics, and the role of logistic regression in binary classification tasks.
